# Data Analysis Project

This project is an unguided exploratory analysis where I worked with a retail sales dataset from kaggle to extract meaningful business insights. My goal was to practice data transformation in Pandas and analyse the clean data in SQL to uncover trends in revenue, customer behaviour and sales patterns across different periods.

## Revenue Analysis

- Electronics generate the most revenue: $156,905, followed by Clothing: $155,580, then Beauty $143,515
- Clothing sells more units but Electronics brings in more revenue per sale
- Beauty has the lowest revenue among the three categories

## Customer Behaviour

#### based on gender

- Beauty products appear to be more popular among women as evident in the higher revenue
- Women also spend more in clothing showing that they have a higher purchasing power in this product category
- Electronics may have a broader appeal among male customers as they generated more revenue in this category
- Overall females are the primary spenders in Beauty and Clothing, while males drove higher sales in Electronics

#### based on age groups

- Age groups (45-54, 25-34, 35-44) generate the most revenue so they should be highly targeted with offers and loyalty programs
- Age group(18-24) purchase less so student discounts and budget friendly options might go a long way to attracting that demographic
- Age group (45-54) has the highest total revenue but lower average order value which means they buy frequently but spend less per transaction while Age group (18-24) being the opposite
- Age group (25-34) has a balanced high total revenue and a stronng average orgder value. This makes them a good segment for premium products and promotions.

## Seasonal insights

- Leveraging high sales months which are May, October and December by running major promotions
- September and March are the lowest months and could use some marketing campaigns and discounts to boost sales
